# guess_number_noir

The guess my number game is a simple and fun way to test your guessing skills. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and allows players to try and guess a randomly-generated number between 1 and 15. If the user's guess is correct, the game will display a winning message and the option to play again. Otherwise, the game will provide feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low.
